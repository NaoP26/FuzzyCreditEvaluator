# FuzzyCreditEvaluator
This project implements a fuzzy logic-based credit evaluation system designed for bank officers to determine housing loan amounts for applicants. It uses the Mamdani inference method and considers both house attributes (market value and location) and applicant information (assets, income, interest rate) in a hierarchical fuzzy structure to provide an intelligent credit assessment. The system includes a user-friendly GUI for easy input and displays detailed membership function information.
